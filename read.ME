Designed to locate a specific GPS-related bug found in a radio system of 400+ units. 
Implemented successfully on 5/31 and may be revisited in the future should a similar bug occur.

A lot of the programming for this project involved working around extraneous issues such as slow connections, incorrect configurations, etc.
The majority of the units were processed without issue, and those few that did have issues were logged in the results db for manual inspection at a later date.
